## [Motivations](#Motivations) ##

I have never been to Boston and was curious to see how certain neighbourhoods are reflected based on their reviews, price of rental and criminal incidents in the area. 

Basically I wanted to break this down by looking at how:
1. reviews of current neighbourhoods and Airbnb accomodation were reflected differently in particular areas. 
2. Cost and availability of accomodation over the seasons
3. crime comparison and how criminal activity reflects on the Airbnb accomodation.
